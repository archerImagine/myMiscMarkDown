# Some Links for starting with Data Science #


Data Science, Big Data, Hadoop, Mahout, R Language, Statistics, Machine Learning, Probability, Linear Algebra all are some of the buzz words in an around the Data Scientist Universe. It looks to me as a Big Black Hole. No idea where to start and how to proceed, what it requires to excel in this field, is P.hD a must, So many question and not one direct answer which I can comprehend. There can be two meaning to this, we both are in different plane I do not understand what the other is speaking.

So I will keep posting links and some of my insights in to these as an when I understand some thing.

Finally after a lot of effort got the definition of Data Scientist and I quote from an Answer in [Quora](http://qr.ae/lYWA5). 

> Data science, as it's practiced, is a blend of Red-Bull-fueled hacking and espresso-inspired statistics.

I would suggest everyone who is starting off in any of the above field to read this article, It gives you an understanding of how these seemingly disjoint looking entities actually have a correlation and overlap among themselves.

## [What are the differences between machine learning and data science?](http://qr.ae/lYomH) ##
The first key thing to understand after finding out about Venn in the previous link, is exactly what is the difference of Machine Learning with Data Science. One important point to remember is that Data Scientist use Machine Learning Algorithms to solve the problem clubbed with the domain knowledge.

Data Scientist may or may not be aware of the implementation of the ML Algorithms.
