# How can you learn Mathematics for machine learning? #
We all know that these are few prerequisite for Machine Learning.

1. Mathematics
2. Statistics
3. Probability
4. Optimization
5. Programming

This post of mostly to understand and find resources for learning Mathematics required for Machine Learning.

The courses and books for Statistics and Probability is already mentioned [here](ProbabilityStatistics4ML.md)

The maths topics which are directly related to Machine Learning are.

* Linear Algebra
* Matrix Manipulation
* Probability Theory


## Linear Algebra ##

The best source to learn Linear Algebra or mathematics in general is the [MIT OCW courses](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses/#mathematics)

The best source for Linear Algebra is.

* [18.06SC | Linear Algebra (Fall 2011) | Prof. Gilbert Strang ](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)

To learn Linear Algebra from the above course there are some Prerequisites.

> To succeed in this course you will need to be comfortable with 
* vectors, 
* matrices, and 
* three-dimensional coordinate systems.   
This material is presented in the first few lectures of 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, 

### Prerequisites ###

* [18.02SC | Multivariable Calculus (Fall 2010) | Prof. Denis Auroux ](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
* [18.01SC | Single Variable Calculus (Fall 2010) | Prof. David Jerison ](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)


## Matrix Manipulation ##
There is only one very good resource available for this.

* [Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications](https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix)

The above is a trim down version, to get the full version you can visit here.

* [CS053 | Brown University ](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs053/current/index.htm)

This course requires programming in python experience.
