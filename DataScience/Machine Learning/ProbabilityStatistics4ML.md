# How do I learn statistics and probability for machine learning? #

We all know that these are few prerequisite for Machine Learning.

1. Mathematics
2. Statistics
3. Probability
4. Optimization
5. Programming

This post of mostly to understand and find resources for learning Statistics and Probability required for Machine Learning.
