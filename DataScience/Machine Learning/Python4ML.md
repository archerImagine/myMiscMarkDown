# How can I start with Machine Learning with Python? #

The few basic Python packages of interest are listed here.

* NumPy
* Pandas
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn


The sequence suggested is.

Start with **NumPy**, as numpy array is the basic data structure on which all scientific computing.  

Followed by **scipy**, This is where most of your more advanced matrix operations and basic optimization routines live.

**Pandas** will give you some convenient data structures and data aggregation/munging functions

**scikit-learn** has most of the unsupervised/supervised learning algorithms you'll want.
