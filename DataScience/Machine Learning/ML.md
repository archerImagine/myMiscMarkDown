# Machine Learning Understanding and Learning #

For the year 2015, my resolution is to understand Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data all these related technologies. So I am in the hunt for resource which can guide me in this direction.

I have limitation which I will list down hear, The biggest of them is procrastination. So as a result of this, I made a plan to study regularly and use pomodoro techniques to keep myself focused. 

So as god was sitting in the heavens and smiling on me, I got these link on Reddit.

* [How can I start with Machine Learning ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ntxgt/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning/)

So taking inspiration from this, I posted another similar Reddit Post.

* [How can I start with Machine Learning with Python.](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2nujc5/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning_with_python/)

The reason being I will follow Python as my language of choice for Machine Learning.

So some interesting links from [How can I start with Machine Learning ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ntxgt/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning/)

The first Link was almost obvious, Link to Andrew Ng's Coursera or Standford Link. So here it is.

## Andrew Ng ##

* [Lecture Collection | Machine Learning | CS 229 | Standford ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599)
* [Lecture Notes and Material of Above ](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html)
* [Coursera ML Class](https://class.coursera.org/ml-007)



Then came a post which is almost game changer for me, something which was tailor made for me, This is a road map to learn Machine learning from books. Learning from books is just like a breath of fresh air for me, though there are so many youtube videos available but books are some thing different.

## [Level-Up Your Machine Learning ](http://www.metacademy.org/roadmaps/cjrd/level-up-your-ml) ##

This link offers 4 levels, the books suggested are as below:-

1. For Novice, [Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight by John W. Foreman ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111866146X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=111866146X&linkCode=as2&tag=metacademy-20&linkId=FXCXLE6R5JAUQ3DR)
2. For Intermediate, [Machine Learning with R](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782162143/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1782162143&linkCode=as2&tag=metacademy-20&linkId=A7H4IRYIG6O64SD4)
3. Little Rigor, [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0387310738&linkCode=as2&tag=metacademy-20&linkId=RBNXLMWNVGBWAHJ5)
4. Master, [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262013193/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262013193&linkCode=as2&tag=metacademy-20&linkId=7ASBQV6PFQBTBMNI)
