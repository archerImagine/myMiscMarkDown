# Machine Learning Understanding and Learning #

For the year 2015, my resolution is to understand Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data all these related technologies. So I am in the hunt for resource which can guide me in this direction.

I have limitation which I will list down hear, The biggest of them is procrastination. So as a result of this, I made a plan to study regularly and use pomodoro techniques to keep myself focused. 

So as god was sitting in the heavens and smiling on me, I got these link on Reddit.

* [How can I start with Machine Learning ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ntxgt/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning/)

So taking inspiration from this, I posted another similar Reddit Post.

* [How can I start with Machine Learning with Python.](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/2nujc5/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning_with_python/)

The reason being I will follow Python as my language of choice for Machine Learning.

So some interesting links from [How can I start with Machine Learning ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ntxgt/how_can_i_start_with_machine_learning/)

The first Link was almost obvious, Link to Andrew Ng's Coursera or Standford Link. So here it is.

# Machine Learning by the Books #

Then came a post which is almost game changer for me, something which was tailor made for me, This is a road map to learn Machine learning from books. Learning from books is just like a breath of fresh air for me, though there are so many youtube videos available but books are some thing different.

## [Level-Up Your Machine Learning ](http://www.metacademy.org/roadmaps/cjrd/level-up-your-ml) ##

This link offers 4 levels, the books suggested are as below:-

1. For Novice, [Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight by John W. Foreman ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111866146X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=111866146X&linkCode=as2&tag=metacademy-20&linkId=FXCXLE6R5JAUQ3DR)

## Prerequisite For Machine Learning ##

These are some of the Prerequisite for understanding machine learning.

* [Mathematics.](Mathematics4ML.md)
* [Statistics.](ProbabilityStatistics4ML.md)
* Probability.
* Optimization
* [Programming.](Python4ML.md)

So I will try to answer all these question separately.
