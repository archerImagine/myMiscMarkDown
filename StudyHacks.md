## How to make good notes from books? ##
The article which a source for this is a LifeHacker article which is referenced [here](http://hackerspace.lifehacker.com/the-easiest-way-to-actively-read-476078116)

As per this there are effectively 3 steps:-
1. Step 1: Skim
2. Step 2: Casual Reading
3. Step 3: Taking Notes While Reading

We will go through the details of these, but just looking at these it looks like something which is radically different than what I have done my whole life.

### Step 1: Skim ###
Before even starting a chapter of a book, do not start to go page by page in the beginning. A better approach is just skim through the chapter, may be read these in the first glance
* First Paragraph
* Headings
* Conclusion - This is a must if you are pressed for time.


By doing this you get a 30,000 feet overview of the chapter, understand the flow of the chapter, but do not put much time in skimming. This process if to get the overview of the chapter.

### Step 2: Casual Reading ###
In this step, you just go through the complete chapter, without bothering to understand each and every line of the chapter, just have a casual reading of the content.

When in this step, keep the highlighter aside, do not think of taking notes, do not think much about any topics which you do not understand. Most of the time our aim while reading a chapter is to take notes, but actually we want to understand the chapter so that we have a better recall during exams, So stop every thought which tells you to take notes every time you open a chapter in a book while in this step.

The reason to do this is because since you have already skimmed through the chapter, while casually reading the chapter will help the brain to process certain information which you might not be even aware that brain is actually processing it.


Make a little notes on small things which you do not understand, like page no or the topic heading with the question.

### Step 3: Taking Notes While Reading ###
When you have successfully completed the previous 2 steps, you brain have much better information then when we started with. Do not blindly write contents from the book onto your notes, this will not help, because when you are blindly copying the contents, you do not need notes, you have the book for the task, also if you copy selectively you will not have the context of information while reading later.
So a better idea for taking notes are as follows:-

* Turn the main idea and key terms into a chart or table for easy access.
* Make connection from the topics to real life, it will help you understand better.

### Bonus Step; Make a Reference Summary ###
When you are through with the chapter, made notes etc, as a last step kindly make a reference summary which give you the complete overview of the chapter.

Always remember the notes which you make should be a standalone entity, which means when there is a need, you can just go through your notes and get the whole picture, there should not be a need to open book or any other reference materials after that.
