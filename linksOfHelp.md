# All the links which I have saved, and a little description on them #

I have hundred's of bookmarks, and most of the time I have not read completely all these bookmarks, so this year I am taking a resolution that I will read all my pending bookmarks and make a short notes on each topic so that I can remember the context of the link.

## [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig ](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) ##
This link is a great article on how actually to learn programming, because the author was very much irritated over the Books Series **Teach Yourself <LanuageName> in 24 Hours**.

There are some things in life which takes time, like a child is born in 9 months, programming cannot be learned in a time frame, you can have basic understanding of syntax etc, but you will never gain the capability to exploit the intricacies of the language.

As a reference he tells that if you have to Learn in Hours, then **Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years**   

The **recipe** to become a great programmer is.  

* Develop **Interest** in programming, do not learn programming for a better job, salary etc. Actually have interest in it.
* **Practice daily**, never break the chain, but do not practice the same thing everyday, challenge yourself.
* **Interact** physically and virtually with fellow programmers, Read Others code.
* Work on Project with others, be good in some and be the worst in others.
* Learn programming language of different paradigm.
* UnderStand the Computer in **Computer Programming**.

## [4 Things I Wish I Would Have Known When I Started My Software Development Career](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/19/software-development-career/) ##

Now this link is also sort of motivational as the last link, which just provides a blueprint for success as a software engineer.

The main points explained by him are:- 

* There is no “right way” in software development
* Reading a book cover-to-cover is not the best way to learn
* Learning particular technologies in-depth is a waste of time
* Community is extremely important in your software development career
* Always have a side project

Actually there are 5 points, but the title suggests there are only 4. So kindly see the blog and verify that if this is applicable to you.
