## [Career Advice: What are the ways to utilize 6 months to build skill-set to get hired at Facebook or Google? - Quora](http://www.quora.com/Career-Advice/What-are-the-ways-to-utilize-6-months-to-build-skill-set-to-get-hired-at-Facebook-or-Google) ##

>I am about to graduate in computer science. During college, I made projects using .NET technologies (C#, ASP.NET, Windows) but I always wanted to be a good programmer and work at Facebook or Google. However, my college degree and CGP won't help me get into FB or GOOG.
I have moderate level programming skills in C++ and Python and am highly interested in web-development.
I researched a bit and found that to get into Facebook or Google I need to master my DS and Algo skills Or begin a start-up and get a chance from there. I'm working on some projects alongside in Python + Flask but there are always team issues, server cost, project failure issues. So i want to focus on DS or Algo way. (I actually want to build enough skill-set to work with FB or GOOG.)
I am free for next 6 months and I have made a target of 5-6 months, and 8-10 hours a day to work on anything or everything so that i can have enough skill set to join Facebook or Google.
How should I be going? I need a concise work-plan to build a good enough skill set. Should I join some other start-up? Should I build my own projects or start-up? Should I just focus on practicing up on DS and Algos?
I have 6 months period of DO WHAT YOU WANT and I want to have good enough skills to get into FB or GOOG.
